# Drug-related deaths in Scotland and the UK

By popular demand, this repository contains code and outputs to produce two maps which visualise:

  * Drug deaths between Scotland, Engish regions, Wales and Northern Ireland, and;
  * Comparisons between Scottish drug death rates and SIMD populations.

These maps use crude death rates to provide a consistent set of figures based on readily available statistics from UK countries. Crude mortality rates are the number of 
deaths per million of the population. Crude rates are used to allow comparisons between populations of different sizes and are a better measure to compare across time than numbers of deaths alone. Crude death rates do not take account of differences in the structure of populations such as the age and sex distribution. 

## Definitions

Drug death data must be interpreted with caution, and definitional and methodological differences considered when comparing between countries. Classifying a death as drug related is complex and there are many different definitions of drug deaths. Care must be taken to ensure consistent definitions are used when making comparisons between countries. The UK comparisons presented here use the ‘drug-related’ deaths definition (sometimes referred to as drug-misuse deaths) – the headline measure in Scotland. It covers all deaths with an underlying cause of drug poisoning or drug abuse, but only where any of the substances involved are controlled in the UK. 

There are differences between Scotland and other parts of the UK in how information about drug deaths is collected. These differences may affect the comparability of 
drug death rates for Scotland and the UK as a whole, but are unlikely to account for the majority of the difference between the rates. More detail on the methodological 
differences can be found in ‘Drug-related deaths in Scotland in 2020 – Annex G’ from National Records of Scotland: https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files//statistics/drug-related-deaths/20/drug-related-deaths-20-annex-g.pdf

Anyone is welcome to use these maps as appropriate. However the definition of a ‘drug death’ is (as outlined above) complicated and can be subject to misinterpretation. Therefore, if you would like to use these maps, please contact Joshua Bird (Joshua.Bird@gov.scot) beforehand to ensure that we can review context and ensure it is presented appropriately.
